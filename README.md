# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The client, Robin, has been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She tasked us with adjusting the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, we leveraged BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

Below is the result of the updated Scraping code
